## 4. Solution Strategy

### 4.1 Technology Strategy

#### Core Technology Choices

| Concern | Technology | Rationale |
|---------|------------|-----------|
| **Language** | Python 3.13+ | Type safety, ecosystem maturity, data science capabilities |
| **Orchestration** | Meltano 3.8.0 | Native ELT framework, Singer ecosystem, proven reliability |
| **Data Integration** | Singer Protocol | Standard specification, rich plugin ecosystem |
| **Configuration** | Pydantic v2 | Type-safe configuration, validation, serialization |
| **Error Handling** | Railway Pattern | Functional error handling, composability |
| **Dependency Injection** | FLEXT Container | Centralized service management, testability |

#### Architecture Principles

1. **Clean Architecture**: Strict separation between business logic and infrastructure
2. **Railway Pattern**: Functional error handling throughout the application
3. **Domain-Driven Design**: Business concepts modeled explicitly
4. **Test-Driven Development**: High test coverage with comprehensive validation
5. **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated deployment and configuration management

### 4.2 Design Decisions

#### Pipeline Architecture Decision

**Decision**: Implement dual pipeline architecture (full sync + incremental sync)

**Rationale**:
- **Full Sync**: Handles schema changes, data reconciliation, comprehensive updates
- **Incremental Sync**: Provides data freshness, reduces processing overhead
- **Separation of Concerns**: Different performance characteristics and business requirements

**Trade-offs**:
- **Positive**: Optimized performance, flexible scheduling, independent scaling
- **Negative**: Increased complexity, configuration duplication, maintenance overhead

#### Native Meltano Decision

**Decision**: Use Meltano 3.8.0 native orchestration instead of abstracted wrapper

**Rationale**:
- **Direct Control**: Full access to Meltano capabilities and configuration
- **Performance**: Reduced abstraction overhead
- **Integration**: Native plugin ecosystem and community support
- **Future-Proofing**: Direct updates from Meltano project

**Trade-offs**:
- **Positive**: Maximum flexibility, latest features, community support
- **Negative**: Tighter coupling, manual plugin management, version compatibility

### 4.3 Quality Measures

#### Code Quality
- **Type Coverage**: 100% type annotations with Pyrefly strict mode
- **Test Coverage**: 90%+ code coverage with comprehensive integration tests
- **Linting**: Ruff with zero violations across all code
- **Documentation**: Arc42 + C4 model with automated maintenance

#### Architecture Quality
- **Clean Architecture**: Verified separation of concerns
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, open/closed, dependency inversion
- **DRY Principle**: Eliminated code duplication through shared libraries
- **YAGNI Principle**: Focused on current requirements without over-engineering

## 8. Concepts (Cross-cutting Concerns)

### 8.1 Domain Concepts

#### Core Business Entities

```plantuml
@startuml Domain_Entities
class "Warehouse Allocation" as Allocation {
  +allocation_id: str
  +item_code: str
  +quantity: decimal
  +location_code: str
  +allocated_date: datetime
  +mod_ts: datetime
}

class "Order Header" as OrderHeader {
  +order_id: str
  +customer_id: str
  +order_date: datetime
  +status: OrderStatus
  +total_amount: decimal
  +mod_ts: datetime
}

class "Order Detail" as OrderDetail {
  +order_id: str
  +line_number: int
  +item_code: str
  +quantity: decimal
  +unit_price: decimal
  +mod_ts: datetime
}

Allocation --> OrderDetail : references
OrderHeader --> OrderDetail : contains
```

#### Business Rules

1. **Allocation Consistency**: Total allocated quantity cannot exceed available inventory
2. **Order Integrity**: Order details must reference valid order headers
3. **Data Freshness**: Incremental updates must use modification timestamp
4. **Schema Validation**: All data must conform to predefined schemas

### 8.2 Error Handling Concept

#### Railway Pattern Implementation

```plantuml
@startuml Railway_Pattern
title Railway Pattern Error Handling

start
:Operation Start;

if (Validation Success?) then (yes)
  :Transform Data;
  if (Transform Success?) then (yes)
    :Load Data;
    if (Load Success?) then (yes)
      :Return Success;
    else (no)
      :Log Load Error;
      :Return Failure;
    endif
  else (no)
    :Log Transform Error;
    :Return Failure;
  endif
else (no)
  :Log Validation Error;
  :Return Failure;
endif

stop

    +user: User
    +token: JWTToken
    +permissions: list

    +has_permission(permission): bool
  }
}

JWTToken --> SecurityContext : creates
OAuth2Client --> JWTToken : generates
RoleBasedAccess --> SecurityContext : provides
ResourceGuard --> RoleBasedAccess : uses
```

### 8.4 Performance Concepts

#### Caching Strategy

```plantuml
@startuml Caching_Strategy
title Multi-Level Caching Architecture

package "Application Cache" {
  class MemoryCache {
    +ttl: int
    +max_size: int

## 9. Architecture Decisions

### 9.1 Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

#### ADR 001: Technology Stack Selection

**Status**: Accepted | **Date**: 2025-01-15

**Context**: Need to select technology stack for enterprise ETL pipeline with Oracle WMS integration.

**Decision**: Use Python 3.13+ with Meltano 3.8.0 orchestration, FLEXT ecosystem libraries, and Pydantic for configuration.

**Rationale**:
- Python provides excellent data processing capabilities
- Meltano offers proven ELT orchestration with Singer ecosystem
- FLEXT provides enterprise patterns and shared infrastructure
- Pydantic ensures type-safe configuration management

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Strong ecosystem support, type safety, proven patterns
- **Negative**: Python GIL limitations for CPU-intensive tasks
- **Risks**: Dependency on FLEXT ecosystem maintenance

#### ADR 002: Pipeline Architecture Pattern

**Status**: Accepted | **Date**: 2025-02-01

**Decision**: Implement dual pipeline architecture with separate full sync and incremental sync pipelines.

**Context**: Need to balance data freshness requirements with processing efficiency.

**Rationale**:
- Full sync ensures data consistency and handles schema changes
- Incremental sync provides real-time data freshness
- Separation allows independent scaling and optimization

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Optimized performance, flexible scheduling, independent scaling
- **Negative**: Increased complexity, configuration duplication
- **Mitigation**: Shared configuration management and monitoring

#### ADR 003: Error Handling Strategy

**Status**: Accepted | **Date**: 2025-02-15

**Decision**: Implement railway pattern with FlextResult[T] throughout the application.

**Context**: Need robust error handling for enterprise data pipeline with complex failure scenarios.

**Rationale**:
- Railway pattern provides composable error handling
- FlextResult[T] ensures type safety in error scenarios
- Functional approach prevents exception-based control flow

**Consequences**:
- **Positive**: Predictable error handling, type safety, composability
- **Negative**: Learning curve for functional programming concepts
- **Training**: Team training on railway pattern implementation

### 10.2 Quality Scenarios

#### Performance Scenario: High Volume Data Load
- **Stimulus**: 100,000 records arrive for processing
- **Environment**: Normal production load
- **Response**: Process completes within 30 minutes
- **Measure**: 99% of records processed successfully, <5% resource utilization spike

#### Reliability Scenario: Network Failure
- **Stimulus**: Network connection to Oracle WMS fails
- **Environment**: Peak business hours
- **Response**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Measure**: Recovery within 5 minutes, no data loss

#### Security Scenario: Unauthorized Access Attempt
- **Stimulus**: Invalid authentication token presented
- **Environment**: Production API endpoint
- **Response**: Immediate rejection with audit logging
- **Measure**: No access granted, full audit trail captured
