**Project**: gruponos-meltano-native | **Framework**: ADR Template | **Status**: Active
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-10 | **ADR Count**: 5

## Overview

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the gruponos-meltano-native project. ADRs document architectural decisions,
    
     their context, rationale, and consequences.

### ADR Process

1. **Create**: Use the ADR template when making significant architectural decisions
2. **Review**: Technical leads review and approve ADRs
3. **Implement**: Implement the approved decision
4. **Document**: Record the final decision and rationale
5. **Maintain**: Update ADRs as decisions evolve or are superseded

### ADR Status Definitions

- **Proposed**: Decision under consideration
- **Accepted**: Decision approved and implemented
- **Rejected**: Decision declined with rationale
- **Deprecated**: Decision no longer relevant
- **Superseded**: Decision replaced by newer ADR

---

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR [Number]: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[Describe the context and problem statement that led to this decision]

## Decision
[Describe the architectural decision that was made]

## Rationale
[Explain the reasoning behind the decision, including trade-offs considered]

## Consequences
### Positive
- [List positive consequences of this decision]

### Negative
- [List negative consequences or drawbacks]

### Risks
- [List risks introduced by this decision]
- [Describe mitigation strategies]

## Alternatives Considered
- [List alternative solutions that were considered]
- [Explain why they were not chosen]

## Implementation

- [External references and research]
```

### ADR Index by Category

#### Technology Decisions
- [ADR 001](adr-001-technology-stack.md): Core technology stack selection
- [ADR 004](adr-004-deployment-strategy.md): Infrastructure and deployment approach

#### Architecture Patterns
- [ADR 002](adr-002-pipeline-architecture.md): ETL pipeline design patterns
- [ADR 003](adr-003-error-handling.md): Error handling and resilience patterns
- [ADR 005](adr-005-monitoring-strategy.md): Observability and monitoring patterns

#### Implementation Decisions
- Future ADRs will document specific implementation choices

## ADR Workflow

### Creating a New ADR

1. **Identify Decision**: Determine if the issue requires an architectural decision
2. **Gather Context**: Collect requirements, constraints, and stakeholder input
3. **Evaluate Options**: Research and evaluate alternative solutions
4. **Document Decision**: Create ADR using the template
5. **Review Process**: Submit for technical review and approval
6. **Implementation**: Implement the approved decision
7. **Follow-up**: Update ADR status and document outcomes

### ADR Review Process

1. **Technical Review**: Architecture and technical leads review the ADR
2. **Stakeholder Input**: Relevant stakeholders provide input
3. **Approval**: Decision approved or sent back for revision
4. **Implementation Planning**: Approved decisions get implementation plans
5. **Documentation**: Final ADR published and communicated

### ADR Maintenance

1. **Regular Review**: Review ADRs quarterly for continued relevance
2. **Status Updates**: Update status as decisions evolve
3. **Supersession**: Create new ADRs when decisions change
4. **Archiving**: Archive deprecated ADRs with cross-references

---

## ADR Quality Standards

### Content Requirements

- **Clear Context**: Problem statement must be well-defined
- **Alternatives**: At least 2-3 alternatives must be considered
- **Rationale**: Decision reasoning must be documented
- **Consequences**: Both positive and negative impacts documented
- **Implementation**: Clear implementation guidance provided

### Review Criteria

- **Technical Soundness**: Decision aligns with technical best practices
- **Business Alignment**: Decision supports business objectives
- **Risk Assessment**: Risks properly identified and mitigated
- **Implementation Feasibility**: Decision can be realistically implemented
- **Future Flexibility**: Decision allows for future evolution

## Tools and Templates

### ADR Creation Tools

```bash
# Create new ADR (requires adr-tools)
adr new "Decision Title"

# List all ADRs
adr list

# Generate ADR index
adr generate index
```

### Template Variables

When creating ADRs, replace these placeholders:

- `[Number]`: Sequential number (001, 002, etc.)
- `[Title]`: Descriptive title of the decision
- `[Status]`: Current status of the decision
- `[Date]`: Date the ADR was created/accepted

---

## Integration with Development Process

### Git Workflow

```bash
# ADR creation during development
git checkout -b feature/architectural-decision
# Create and review ADR
git add docs/architecture/adrs/adr-XXX-title.md
git commit -m "docs: add ADR XXX - Title"
git push origin feature/architectural-decision
```

### CI/CD Integration

- ADR validation in CI pipelines
- Automatic status updates
- Link validation and formatting checks
- Stakeholder notification on new ADRs

### Documentation Integration

- ADR references in code comments
- ADR links in architecture documentation
- ADR status in project dashboards
- ADR summaries in release notes

---

## ADR Metrics and Reporting

### Quality Metrics

- **ADR Coverage**: Percentage of architectural decisions documented
- **Review Cycle Time**: Average time from creation to acceptance
- **Implementation Alignment**: Percentage of ADRs properly implemented
- **Maintenance Rate**: Frequency of ADR updates and reviews

### Reporting

- **Monthly Reports**: ADR status and new decisions
- **Quarterly Reviews**: ADR relevance and updates needed
- **Annual Audits**: Comprehensive ADR review and cleanup

---

## Examples and Best Practices

### Good ADR Example

**Title**: Use Railway Pattern for Error Handling

**Context**: Need robust error handling for complex data pipelines with multiple failure points.

**Decision**: Implement railway pattern using FlextResult[T] throughout the application.

**Rationale**: Provides composable error handling, type safety, and functional programming benefits.

### ADR Anti-Patterns

❌ **Decision without context**: "We decided to use Python" (missing why, alternatives, trade-offs)

❌ **No alternatives considered**: Only documents the chosen solution

❌ **Missing consequences**: Doesn't document downsides or risks

❌ **Implementation without decision**: Code written before architectural decision
