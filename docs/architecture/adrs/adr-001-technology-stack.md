# ADR 001: Technology Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The gruponos-meltano-native project requires a technology stack for building an enterprise-grade ETL pipeline that integrates Oracle Warehouse Management System (WMS) data with downstream analytics databases. The system must handle high-volume data processing, ensure data quality, provide robust error handling, and support production deployment in enterprise environments.

Key requirements include:
- Data extraction from Oracle WMS REST APIs
- Data transformation and validation
- Data loading into Oracle analytics databases
- Scalable processing of 100K+ records per operation
- 99.5% uptime and error recovery capabilities
- Enterprise security and compliance requirements

## Decision

We will use the following core technology stack:

- **Language**: Python 3.13+
- **Orchestration**: Meltano 3.8.0 (native, not wrapper)
- **Data Integration**: Singer Protocol
- **Configuration**: Pydantic v2
- **Error Handling**: Railway Pattern with FlextResult[T]
- **Framework**: FLEXT ecosystem libraries

## Rationale

### Python 3.13+ Selection
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced type annotations and runtime type checking
- **Performance**: Significant performance improvements over previous versions
- **Ecosystem**: Rich data science and ETL libraries
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Widely used in enterprise environments
- **Future-Proofing**: Latest stable version with long-term support

### Meltano 3.8.0 Native Orchestration
- **Direct Control**: Full access to Meltano capabilities without abstraction layers
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Access to entire Singer plugin ecosystem
- **Performance**: No overhead from wrapper libraries
- **Maintenance**: Direct updates from Meltano project
- **Integration**: Native support for enterprise deployment patterns

### Singer Protocol for Data Integration
- **Standard Specification**: Open standard for data integration
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Thousands of available connectors
- **Proven Reliability**: Used by major ETL platforms
- **Flexibility**: Support for any data source/target combination
- **Community Support**: Active development and maintenance

### Pydantic v2 for Configuration
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time and runtime validation
- **Performance**: Significant performance improvements over v1
- **Features**: Advanced validation rules and serialization
- **Integration**: Excellent FastAPI and Python ecosystem integration
- **Maintainability**: Self-documenting configuration schemas

### Railway Pattern with FlextResult[T]
- **Error Handling**: Composable, functional error handling
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time error type checking
- **Debugging**: Clear error propagation and handling
- **Maintainability**: Consistent error handling patterns
- **Testing**: Easier testing of error scenarios

### FLEXT Ecosystem Integration
- **Shared Patterns**: Consistent architectural patterns across projects
- **Quality Standards**: Established testing and documentation practices
- **Infrastructure**: Shared deployment and monitoring capabilities
- **Collaboration**: Cross-team knowledge sharing and standards
- **Maintenance**: Centralized library maintenance and updates

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Consistency**: Unified technology choices across FLEXT ecosystem
- **Maintainability**: Well-established patterns and practices
- **Scalability**: Proven technologies for enterprise workloads
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing FLEXT projects
- **Support**: Active communities and commercial support available

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn FLEXT patterns and railway programming
- **Dependency**: Reliance on FLEXT ecosystem maintenance
- **Complexity**: Additional abstraction layers to learn and maintain
- **Migration**: Potential migration effort if FLEXT patterns change

### Risks
- **FLEXT Ecosystem Changes**: Potential breaking changes in FLEXT libraries
- **Python 3.13 Adoption**: Limited ecosystem support initially
- **Meltano Evolution**: Potential changes in Meltano architecture
- **Team Training**: Time investment in learning new patterns

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Version Pinning**: Pin FLEXT dependencies to stable versions
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of FLEXT integration points
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation of FLEXT patterns usage
- **Training**: Team training on railway pattern and FLEXT ecosystem
- **Monitoring**: Regular monitoring of FLEXT ecosystem changes

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Java/Spring Boot Stack
- **Pros**: Enterprise maturity, performance, extensive tooling
- **Cons**: Higher complexity, longer development cycles, steeper learning curve
- **Rejected**: Python better suited for data processing, team has Python expertise

### Alternative 2: Node.js/Microservices Architecture
- **Pros**: JavaScript ecosystem, microservices flexibility
- **Cons**: Type safety concerns, callback hell potential, data processing limitations
- **Rejected**: Python superior for data processing, type safety requirements

### Alternative 3: Go/Kubernetes Native
- **Pros**: Performance, container-native, strong concurrency
- **Cons**: Data science libraries limited, team learning curve
- **Rejected**: Python ecosystem better for ETL/data processing requirements

### Alternative 4: Meltano with Custom Wrapper
- **Pros**: Potentially better integration with existing systems
- **Cons**: Maintenance overhead, potential abstraction leaks
- **Rejected**: Native Meltano provides better control and future compatibility

### Alternative 5: Apache Airflow for Orchestration
- **Pros**: Python-native, extensive operator ecosystem
- **Cons**: Heavier infrastructure requirements, more complex deployment
- **Rejected**: Meltano specifically designed for ELT, better Singer integration
