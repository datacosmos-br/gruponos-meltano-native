# ADR 005: Monitoring Strategy

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The gruponos-meltano-native system requires comprehensive monitoring capabilities to ensure operational visibility, performance tracking, and proactive issue detection for enterprise ETL operations. The system processes critical warehouse data with strict SLAs and must provide real-time insights into pipeline health, data quality, and system performance.

Key monitoring requirements include:
- Real-time pipeline execution visibility
- Data quality and completeness monitoring
- Performance metrics and bottleneck detection
- Error tracking and alerting capabilities
- Business KPI monitoring and reporting
- Compliance and audit trail monitoring

## Decision

Implement a comprehensive monitoring strategy using FLEXT Observability framework with layered monitoring approach:

### Monitoring Layers

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Operational Visibility**: Complete system observability across all layers
- **Proactive Issue Detection**: Automated alerting and anomaly detection
- **Performance Optimization**: Data-driven performance tuning and capacity planning
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Automated audit trail and compliance reporting
- **Incident Response**: Fast root cause analysis and resolution
- **Business Intelligence**: Real-time operational insights and KPIs

### Negative
- **Implementation Complexity**: Multi-layer monitoring setup and configuration
- **Resource Overhead**: Additional infrastructure and operational costs
- **Alert Fatigue**: Potential for excessive alerting without proper tuning
- **Learning Curve**: Team training required for monitoring tools and practices
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Ongoing dashboard and alert rule maintenance

### Risks
- **Monitoring Blind Spots**: Incomplete coverage leading to undetected issues
- **Alert Overload**: Too many alerts reducing response effectiveness
- **Performance Impact**: Monitoring overhead affecting system performance
- **Data Privacy**: Sensitive data exposure in monitoring systems
- **Dependency on Tools**: Vendor lock-in and tool reliability dependencies

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Phased Implementation**: Start with core metrics and expand gradually
- **Alert Tuning**: Implement alert thresholds and deduplication
- **Performance Testing**: Monitor monitoring system performance impact
- **Security Reviews**: Regular security audits of monitoring infrastructure
- **Training Programs**: Comprehensive team training on monitoring practices
- **Tool Evaluation**: Regular assessment of monitoring tool effectiveness

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Application Insights Only
- **Description**: Use Azure Application Insights for all monitoring needs
- **Pros**: Native Azure integration, managed service, comprehensive features
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, potential cost issues, less control over data
- **Rejected**: FLEXT ecosystem integration requirements, need for custom ETL metrics

### Alternative 2: Custom Monitoring Solution
- **Description**: Build custom monitoring using Python logging and metrics
- **Pros**: Full control, tailored to specific needs, no external dependencies
- **Cons**: High development and maintenance cost, reinventing existing solutions
- **Rejected**: Time and resource constraints, need for proven monitoring capabilities

### Alternative 3: ELK Stack Integration
- **Description**: Use Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana for comprehensive monitoring
- **Pros**: Powerful log analysis, flexible visualization, open-source
- **Cons**: Complex setup and maintenance, resource intensive, learning curve
- **Rejected**: FLEXT ecosystem already provides monitoring framework, avoid complexity

### Alternative 4: Minimal Monitoring
- **Description**: Basic logging and error tracking without comprehensive metrics
- **Pros**: Simple implementation, low overhead, quick to deploy
- **Cons**: Limited visibility, reactive instead of proactive, compliance gaps
- **Rejected**: Enterprise requirements for comprehensive monitoring and SLAs
