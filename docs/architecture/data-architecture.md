## 📋 Data Architecture Overview

The gruponos-meltano-native system implements a comprehensive data architecture that orchestrates the flow of warehouse management system (WMS) data through extraction, transformation, and loading processes while maintaining data quality, lineage, and governance.

### Data Architecture Principles

- **Data as a Product**: Treat data as valuable business assets
- **Domain Ownership**: Clear ownership and accountability for data
- **Data Quality First**: Quality gates and validation at every step
- **Event-Driven Processing**: Real-time and batch processing capabilities
- **Data Lineage**: Complete traceability from source to consumption
