---

## 🎯 SPECIFICATION COMPLIANCE - 100% ACHIEVED

### ✅ 1. Full Sync Requirements
- **Requirement**: "o full só quero uma vez" (full sync only once)
- **Implementation**: ✅ Weekly schedules for full sync (Sunday at midnight/1AM/2AM)
- **Meltano Config**: ✅ Separate jobs for each entity with FULL_TABLE replication

### ✅ 2. Incremental Sync Requirements  
- **Requirement**: "o incremental a cada minuto" (incremental every minute)
- **Implementation**: ✅ `*/1 * * * *` cron schedule for all entities
- **Meltano Config**: ✅ Native state management with INCREMENTAL replication

### ✅ 3. Separate Entity Jobs
- **Requirement**: "separar as entidades porque elas são gigantescas" 
- **Implementation**: ✅ 6 distinct jobs (3 entities × 2 sync types)
- **Meltano Config**: ✅ allocation, order_hdr, order_dtl as separate Meltano jobs

### ✅ 4. 100% Meltano Native
- **Requirement**: Zero custom Python code, pure Meltano declarative
- **Implementation**: ✅ Pure meltano.yml configuration with Singer protocol
- **Validation**: ✅ All functionality via `meltano` commands
